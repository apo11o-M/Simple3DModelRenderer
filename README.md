# Simple 3D Model Renderer

## What is this?
This is a python script that transform a set of points from a 3D space onto the screen using some math and the python turtle library.

Currently I am still experimenting with the concept so it runs very slow and have limited features. In the future I will be constantly adding more stuff such as being able to move the camera and improve the performance so it can draw out the model more quickly.

## How do I use it?
There are two ways of running this and seeing the effect.

**The easy, more simpler way**
- I have post this smol project on Replit, you can check out this blog post and run it through the browser: https://replit.com/talk/share/Simple-Block-Model-Renderer/129897

**The other way**
- If you want to see how it works or make some changes, you can download this script and run it in your terminal.
- Navigate to the directory of the file and run the script like so: `python main.py`
- There should be a pop off window with the points and lines being drawn in the window, and the cube model being rotated almost every seconds.
